			## SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ISSSUES ###

General Approach

-I have used some pseudo code so that i can make my design easier.

-I have written my simulation in Java. I used the Netbeans IDE, JDK & JRE 1.7 bundle to develop and execute my simulation. The IDE has built in debugger to debug the files.

-BULK COMPLEXITIES
	- # of Files   	   : 7
	- # of Classes     : 9
	- # of Methods     : 36
	- # of Code	   : 175 + 167 + 717 = 1059
	- NOB		   : 175
	- NOC		   : 167
	- EXS		   : 717
	- NOD		   : 106
	- NOSF		   : 39
	- NOSM		   : 13
					NOB	NOC	EXS	NOM	NOD
		CPU			71	56	343	7	75
		ErrorHandler		25	31	95	5	16		
		Loader			12	11	42	2	3
		Memory			9	8	14	2	0
		Stack			18	4	70	12	4
		System			6	1	22	1	2
		Variable		34	41	131	7	6
					
					175	167	717	36	106
		
NOB = # of blank lines, NOC= # of comments, EXS= # of Executable Statements
NOM = # of Methods, NOD= # of decisions, NOSF = # of Static Variables
NOSM = # of Static Methods

		CODING 	  : 20 Working Hours
		TESTING	  : 30 Working Hours
		

- As Java being platform independent my simulation can work in other operating systems (Windows or Linux)

- As Java being an object oriented language so that to make my simulation more modular I prefer Java to others. Its gives an ease to implement Threads which might required in the future simulations(for steps 2 and 3) so I prefer it. As if there is any problem with a single class i can change only that class rather than making the code more complex to understand
